    <string name="det1">
Congratulations to Team Liquid, Grand Champions at The International 2024. Dropping only three games throughout their championship run, this relentless Liquid squad washed away a field of fearsome contenders to resoundingly earn their place as the finest Dota team in the world.

Team Liquid\'s journey to the Aegis started smoothly with a pair of 2-0 series wins over Aurora and beastcoast, but a 0-2 showing against defending champions Team Spirit reminded everyone that the path to immortality is filled with formidable foes.

Their next opponent would only prove that point further. With Liquid holding a 1-0 advantage and the Upper Bracket almost within reach, underdogs BB Team ran away with the second match of their seeding set, threatening Liquid with a much more difficult Lower Bracket path. Undaunted, Liquid leveraged early action in game three to build an avalanching lead and ultimately secure their place in the Upper Bracket to begin the next stage.

Once there, the eventual champions never looked back. Their heroes were almost unkillable in a dominating 2-0 win over Xtreme Gaming, with only a single death amongst them in game two. Carrying that momentum forward, they opened their series on the main stage against Cloud9 with another stomp. Game two turned into a closer back-and-forth fight, but Liquid rode an epic late game teamwipe to victory and a place in the Upper Bracket Final against a familiar opponent — and constant obstacle in their path — the dangerous Gaimin Gladiators.

Flipping precedent, Liquid withstood Gaimin\'s early aggression and took the series 2-0, marching convincingly into the Grand Final. After Gaimin battled their way back for a rematch, Team Liquid took the chance to demonstrate that the results of the first matchup were no fluke. They dispatched their old nemesis in decisive 3-0 fashion to secure the Aegis and a place in Dota 2 history.

As bearers of the ultimate symbol of victory, these names shall forever be inscribed upon the Aegis of Champions:

2024 - Team Liquid
Michael &quot;miCKe&quot; Vu
Micha &quot;Nisha&quot; Jankowski
Neta &quot;33&quot; Shapira
Samuel &quot;Boxi&quot; Svahn
Aydin &quot;Insania&quot; Sarkohi

Looking Back

We would like to once again thank all of the players, talent, and everyone in the Dota community for helping bring this global celebration to life. If you missed any of the tournament, or just want to relive the incredible plays, head over to the Dota 2 YouTube channel, where you can find replays of the entire tournament. You can also find a trove of photos from the event over on the Dota 2 Instagram and Dota 2 flickr.

Celebrate the Champions
